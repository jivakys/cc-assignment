## Aggregation Queries ##

### 1. Find the total amount spent by each customer.

    db.orders.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
        _id: "$customerId",
        totalSpendAmount: { $sum: "$amount" }
        }
    }
    ])


### 2. Retrieve order details along with corresponding customer information.
    db.orders.aggregate([
        {
            $lookup: {
            from: "customers",
            localField: "customerId",
            foreignField: "_id",
            as: "customerInfo"
            }
        },
        {
            $unwind: "$customerInfo"
        }
    ])

### 3. Find orders where the amount is greater than Rs. 500.
    db.orders.aggregate([
        {
            $match: {
            amount: { $gt: 500 }
            }
        }
    ])


### 4. Calculate the average order amount per customer.
    db.orders.aggregate([
        {
            $group: {
            _id: "$customerId",
            avgPerOrder: { $avg: "$amount" }
            }
        }
    ])

Retrieve all orders with customer details, ensuring each order has an associated customer record.
